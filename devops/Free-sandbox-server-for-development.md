## Free sandbox server for development

We can use Heroku as a forever-free sandbox solution for testing or hosting micro service. Adding a credit card to have 1000 free computing hours.

Heroku will make a service down if no received request come. We can use a cronjob-like service to check health service and keep it live !!! ;)

Cronjob check health service : pingdom, statuscake, port-monitor, uptimerobot
